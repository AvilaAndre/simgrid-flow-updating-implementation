# SimGrid Flow Updating Implementation

This repository contains the implementations of the flow updating algorithms in the SimGrid simulator.

## Getting Started

You will need Python3 to run this project.


In order to setup the virtual environment and install the dependencies you can use the `setup.sh` bash file.

Use it by running:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

It will create the `.venv` folder, which you can use to activate the virtual environment by running:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
